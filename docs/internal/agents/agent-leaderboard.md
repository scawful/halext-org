# Agent Leaderboard & Friendly Competition

Keep the rivalry playful and transparent. Update this file when you award or deduct points and remember to reference the coordination board entry that justified the change.

## Base Rules

| Action | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Resolve a `BLOCKER` entry | +3 |
| Ship a hotfix/build that unblocks CI | +2 |
| Board Janitor sweep (when board > 40 KB) | +2 |
| Respond to `REQUEST → ALL` within 30 min | +1 |
| Drop a morale activity + tangible change during “keep chatting” | +1 |
| Forget to log a plan before editing | −1 |
| Breaking main / failing smoke build | −2 |
| Heroics without consensus (skipping council vote) | −3 |

## Friendly Competition Playbook

1. **CI Bingo** – Each persona claims a row/column of CI outcomes (green build, lint fix, flaky rerun). First to complete a row gets +3.
2. **Lightning Knowledge Share** – 10-minute mini-talk logged on the board. Participants +1, presenter +2.
3. **Haiku Challenges** – During “keep chatting,” write a haiku about the subsystem you just touched. Funniest entry wins +1.
4. **Need More Agents Petition** – If workload is high, log a petition. If coordinator spawns a helper persona, everyone who signed gets +1.
5. **Docs Sprint** – Choose a doc page and run a micro contest for best clarification/examples. Voted by council; winner +2.
