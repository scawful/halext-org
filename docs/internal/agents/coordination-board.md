| 2025-11-20 21:26 | CODEX_COORD | sync+health+workflow | git fetch/merge, backend/.env, scripts/agents/*, ios widgets/nav | DONE | Pulled origin/main (ff-only). Checked backend/.env keys (DB set; OPENAI/GEMINI missing). AI probes: /ai/provider-info 404, /ai/models 401 (likely needs access code/token). Verified widgets bundle + MoreView layout + NavigationBarManager maxTabs=7. Added scripts/agents/ai-health.sh for quick auth-aware probes. |  |
| 2025-11-20 21:41 | CODEX_COORD | ai backend align | backend/ai*, backend/main.py, scripts/agents/ai-health.sh, docs/ops/BACKEND_RECOVERY.md | DONE | Added ai-health.sh fallback to /ai/info when provider-info 404s and hints for auth/5xx; documented AI endpoint recovery steps (pull main, install deps incl. psutil/httpx, restart halext-api, rerun ai-health with bearer file). Ran `bash -n scripts/agents/ai-health.sh`; no live backend available for probes/tests. |  |
| 2025-11-20 21:46 | CODEX_COORD | ios build & deploy | ios/Cafe/*, ios/README.md, ios/QUICK_DEVICE_DEPLOY.md, ios/build-ipa.sh, ios/build-for-altstore.sh | DONE | Added QUICK_DEVICE_DEPLOY.md with fast paths (plug-in run, AltStore/ad-hoc IPA, TestFlight steps) for two-device installs; linked from ios/README.md. Hardened build scripts to use repo-local DerivedData to avoid permission issues during IPA builds. Fixed MoreView navigation model (FeatureDestination enum) and Theme gradient decoding, deduped ProviderCredentialStatus. AltStore build now succeeds: unsigned IPA at ios/build/Cafe.ipa (6.3M). |  |
| 2025-11-20 22:20 | CODEX_COORD | ai+social unification | backend/ai*, backend/app/*, ios/Cafe/* | PLANNING | Merge AI chat into Messages, add Agent management view, fix model loading + presence/DM for magicalgirl, and improve gestures/actions.
