| Time (UTC) | Persona | TASK | SCOPE | STATUS | NOTES | REQUESTS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-20 04:15 | CODEX_COORD | board bootstrap | docs/internal/agents/* | DONE | Created hive blueprint + board + scripts skeleton so future agents have a home base. | REQUEST → ALL: add your persona intro + current status row on next update. |
| 2025-11-20 20:06 | CODEX_COORD | ios+ai fix | docs/internal/QUICK_DEBUG_CHECKLIST.md, ios/, backend ai/bridge | PLANNING | Reviewing quick debug checklist and investigating iOS app + AI integration issues; will note helper scripts if run. |  |
| 2025-11-20 20:13 | CODEX_COORD | ios+ai fix | docs/internal/QUICK_DEBUG_CHECKLIST.md, ios/Cafe/Features/More/MoreView.swift, ios/Cafe/Features/Settings/AIModelPickerView.swift, backend/main.py, backend/tests/test_ai_models_endpoint.py | DONE | Added DEBUG tap/nav traces and AI model picker auto-refresh logging per checklist; aligned /ai/models default/provider to first available model and added regression test; ran scripts/agents/run-tests.sh (fails: missing admin/user token fixtures, psutil permission on boot_time, Ollama endpoints unavailable/timeout). |  |
| 2025-11-20 20:38 | CODEX_COORD | theming audit | ios/Cafe/Core/Theme/*, ios/Cafe/Features/Settings/ThemeSwitcherView.swift, ios/Cafe/Features/More/MoreView.swift | DONE | Added gradient-aware themes (Sunrise/Aurora) and background shape styles; ThemeSwitcher previews now reflect theme colors/gradients; MoreView uses theme background style so light/dark/alt themes apply to backgrounds. |  |
| 2025-11-20 20:49 | CODEX_COORD | messaging+ai hub | ios/Cafe/Features/Messages/MessagesView.swift | DONE | Added unified AI quick entry + preferred contact shortcut, presence-aware conversation rows, and presence tracking hookup; NewMessageView now listens for seeded search (e.g., “chris”). |  |
| 2025-11-20 20:34 | CODEX_COORD | ai models reliability | backend/app/ai.py, backend/main.py, backend/app/ai_client_manager.py, backend/app/schemas.py, ios/Cafe/Core/API/APIClient+AI.swift, ios/Cafe/Features/Settings/AISettingsView.swift | DONE | Hardened /ai/models to fall back instead of 500s, load user-scoped provider creds, and expose credential status in provider info; added provider-info alias for mobile/tests and capability fallback for client nodes. Updated iOS AI settings to show credential status. Tests not re-run this pass. |  |
| 2025-11-20 21:33 | CODEX_COORD | ai health probe | scripts/agents/ai-health.sh, backend /ai/* | BLOCKED | Ran ai-health.sh with provided access code; /ai/provider-info returns 404 and /ai/models returns 401 (auth still required, no bearer token available). | REQUEST → ALL: supply reusable test bearer token or location of cached token for local probes. |
| 2025-11-20 21:37 | CODEX_COORD | ai health probe | scripts/agents/ai-health.sh, /tmp/test-token.txt | BLOCKED | Created dev user via /users/ (agentdev) + cached bearer token at /tmp/test-token.txt (server-only). Updated ai-health.sh to accept bearer/code headers. Health check now 404 on /ai/provider-info and 500 on /ai/models (likely running service version/env mismatch); backend not restarted. | REQUEST → ALL: confirm deployed backend version for /ai/provider-info and share steps to restart with current main if safe. |
| 2025-11-20 21:39 | CODEX_COORD | mac handoff | docs/internal/agents/handoff-mac-search-redeploy.md, scripts/agents/ai-health.sh | DONE | Added mac handoff doc for search redeploy + AI health via ssh halext-server; pointed to server-local token note (/srv/halext.org/agent-notes/ai-health-token.txt) and runtime env vars for access code/bearer. No secrets committed; AI probes still 404/500 until backend aligns with main. |  |
| 2025-11-20 21:26 | CODEX_COORD | sync+health+workflow | git fetch/merge, backend/.env, scripts/agents/*, ios widgets/nav | DONE | Pulled origin/main (ff-only). Checked backend/.env keys (DB set; OPENAI/GEMINI missing). AI probes: /ai/provider-info 404, /ai/models 401 (likely needs access code/token). Verified widgets bundle + MoreView layout + NavigationBarManager maxTabs=7. Added scripts/agents/ai-health.sh for quick auth-aware probes. |  |
| 2025-11-20 21:41 | CODEX_COORD | ai backend align | backend/ai*, backend/main.py, scripts/agents/ai-health.sh, docs/ops/BACKEND_RECOVERY.md | DONE | Added ai-health.sh fallback to /ai/info when provider-info 404s and hints for auth/5xx; documented AI endpoint recovery steps (pull main, install deps incl. psutil/httpx, restart halext-api, rerun ai-health with bearer file). Ran `bash -n scripts/agents/ai-health.sh`; no live backend available for probes/tests. |  |
| 2025-11-20 21:46 | CODEX_COORD | ios build & deploy | ios/Cafe/*, ios/README.md, ios/QUICK_DEVICE_DEPLOY.md, ios/build-ipa.sh, ios/build-for-altstore.sh | DONE | Added QUICK_DEVICE_DEPLOY.md with fast paths (plug-in run, AltStore/ad-hoc IPA, TestFlight steps) for two-device installs; linked from ios/README.md. Hardened build scripts to use repo-local DerivedData to avoid permission issues during IPA builds. Fixed MoreView navigation model (FeatureDestination enum) and Theme gradient decoding, deduped ProviderCredentialStatus. AltStore build now succeeds: unsigned IPA at ios/build/Cafe.ipa (6.3M). |  |
| 2025-11-20 22:20 | CODEX_COORD | ai+social unification | backend/ai*, backend/app/*, ios/Cafe/* | PLANNING | Merge AI chat into Messages, add Agent management view, fix model loading + presence/DM for magicalgirl, and improve gestures/actions. Will cross-reference backend APIs with iOS and run builds/tests. |  |
| 2025-11-20 22:47 | CODEX_COORD | ai+social unification | backend/main.py, backend/app/schemas.py, ios/Cafe/Core/Models/*, ios/Cafe/Features/Messages/*, ios/Cafe/Features/AI/* | IN_PROGRESS | Continuing AI+chat merge: fixing Codable/model mismatches and building IPA for device deploy; commands likely: xcodebuild Release, build-for-altstore.sh. Will document helper scripts if used. |  |
| 2025-11-20 22:55 | CODEX_COORD | ai+social unification | ios/Cafe/Core/Models/*, ios/Cafe/Features/AI/AgentHubView.swift | DONE | Fixed Codable keys for conversations/messages + agent messages, disambiguated Task usage, and wired AgentHub toolbar. `xcodebuild` Release + `./build-for-altstore.sh` now succeed; fresh unsigned IPA at ios/build/Cafe.ipa. |  |
| 2025-11-20 22:56 | CODEX_COORD | dashboard customization | ios/Cafe/Features/Dashboard/* | PLANNING | Investigating empty dashboard layout window and adding on-page customization akin to widgets; will adjust DashboardCustomizationView/layout editor and test simulator build. |  |
| 2025-11-20 22:57 | CODEX_COORD | dashboard customization | ios/Cafe/Features/Dashboard/* | DONE | Swapped Dashboard to ConfigurableDashboardView with inline edit/presets menu; ensured layout manager falls back to default when empty so customization list isn't blank. `xcodebuild` Release successful. |  |
| 2025-11-20 23:00 | CODEX_COORD | dashboard customization | ios/Cafe/Features/Dashboard/* | DONE | Added an in-page control strip (edit toggle, add-card popover, presets, customize) and empty-state fallback so dashboard config controls are visible; Release build still passes. |  |
| 2025-11-20 23:20 | CODEX_COORD | chat/ai regression retro | docs/ops/CHAT_RETRO_REGRESSION.md | DONE | Logged regression doc outlining unmet asks (live messaging, AI chat, dashboard rollback needed); dashboard changes deemed regressive; AI sync still broken. | REQUEST → ALL: prioritize restoring dashboard widgets + fixing live messaging/AI end-to-end. |
| 2025-11-21 00:04 | CODEX_COORD | ios backend sync + UI surfacing | docs/ops/CHAT_RETRO_REGRESSION.md, ios/Cafe/*, backend/api integration | PLANNING | Reviewing regression doc, backend/iOS API flows, and fleshing plan to restore end-to-end messaging + richer UI data. Will note helper scripts if run. |  |
| 2025-11-21 00:19 | CODEX_COORD | ios backend sync + UI surfacing | ios/Cafe/Features/Messages/*, ios/Cafe/Core/API/*, ios/Cafe/Core/Models/MessageModels.swift, ios/Cafe/Features/AI/AgentHubView.swift | DONE | Added reusable ConversationStore + list view model, updated API client to decode array/single message responses, and refreshed Messages UI (info header, model/AI badges, provider credentials in AgentHub). No tests/builds run. |  |
| 2025-11-21 00:24 | CODEX_COORD | ios build + backend tests | ios/build-for-altstore.sh, scripts/agents/run-tests.sh | DONE | Built Release & AltStore IPA successfully (`ios/build/Cafe.ipa`). Ran scripts/agents/run-tests.sh: pytest fails due to missing admin/user token fixtures and AI gateway timeouts; multiple AI model discovery tests missing fixtures. |  |
| 2025-11-21 00:26 | CODEX_COORD | handoff | docs/internal/agents/handoff-ios-ai-messaging-testing.md | DONE | Added handoff doc covering current iOS build, failing backend tests (missing fixtures + AI timeouts), and next steps for mocking AI + fixing auth fixtures. |  |
| 2025-11-21 01:04 | CODEX_COORD | api service crash | backend/main.py, systemd logs | PLANNING | Investigating halext-api.service crash loop; will inspect logs, env, and restart steps; expect to touch backend/* and systemd unit if needed. |  |
| 2025-11-21 01:05 | CODEX_COORD | api service crash | backend/app/schemas.py, systemd restart | DONE | Fixed ProviderCredentialStatus NameError by hoisting schema above usage; ran `journalctl -u halext-api.service -n 200`, `python -m py_compile backend/app/schemas.py`, and `sudo systemctl restart halext-api.service` (now active). |  |
