# Archived AI Documentation

This directory contains outdated or superseded AI documentation that has been consolidated into the main guides.

## What Happened?

The AI routing documentation was consolidated to reduce duplication:

- **Multiple routing docs** → Consolidated into `AI_ROUTING.md`
- **Multiple Ollama setup docs** → Merged into `OLLAMA_SETUP.md` with sections for local and remote scenarios
- **Implementation reports** → Historical reference only (some info preserved in main docs)

## Current Documentation Structure

- `AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall AI system architecture
- `AI_ROUTING.md` - Complete AI routing guide (implementation, roadmap, testing)
- `OLLAMA_SETUP.md` - Ollama setup guide (local network + remote/exposed)
- `MESSAGING_AI_ROUTING.md` - Messaging-specific AI routing details
- `OPENWEBUI_SETUP.md` - OpenWebUI integration guide
- `CONNECTING_MAC_TO_UBUNTU.md` - Mac-to-Ubuntu connection guide

## Archived Files

The following files were archived here:
- `AI_ROUTING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Merged into AI_ROUTING.md
- `AI_ROUTING_ROADMAP.md` - Merged into AI_ROUTING.md
- `AI_ROUTING_TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - Merged into AI_ROUTING.md
