# Archived iOS Documentation

This directory contains outdated or superseded iOS documentation that has been consolidated into the main guides.

## What Happened?

The iOS documentation was consolidated to reduce duplication and confusion:

- **Setup guides** → Consolidated into `README.md` and `SETUP.md`
- **Quick start guides** → Merged into `README.md` quick start section
- **Feature summaries** → Latest features documented in `FEATURES.md`
- **Implementation reports** → Historical reference only

## Current Documentation Structure

- `README.md` - Main project overview and quick start
- `SETUP.md` - Developer setup guide (most comprehensive)
- `FEATURES.md` - Complete feature documentation
- `QUICK_DEVICE_DEPLOY.md` - Fast paths for device deployment
- `TESTFLIGHT_SETUP.md` - TestFlight distribution guide
